You will comment on whether there is a statistically significant difference between the False Positive Rates (and other metrics) for African-Americans and Caucasians using the `LR_2_NORACE` model, and then repeat the analysis for the `LR_2_RACE` model. You will also assess the difference between the metrics across the two different models to examine whether the exclusion of race leads to the elimination of racial disparities in human recidivism prediction. Finally, you will discuss what you believe are larger societal reasons for your results.\n",

Please cite all the sources you consult for this blog-post. (Here is [one source](https://towardsdatascience.com/inferential-statistics-series-t-test-using-numpy-2718f8f9bf2f), for example).\n",
